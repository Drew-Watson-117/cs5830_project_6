- Study the effect of Evapotranspiration on observed baseflow. 
  - Examine a certain area
  - Can plot distributions of Evapotranspiration for each area
    - Look at whether areas with less evapotranspiration have less baseflow
  - Look at regression plot of Evapotranspiration vs. observed baseflow

Things to ask:

- Is using linear regression to compare old baseflow with new baseflow worthwhile?
  - If so, is my approach valid?
- Do you know how to label points with seaborn?

What else to do

- Find p-value or R^2 for each model, use that as measure of trustworthiness of model
