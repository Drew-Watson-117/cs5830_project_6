- Study the effect of Evapotranspiration on observed baseflow. 
  - Examine a certain area
  - Can plot distributions of Evapotranspiration for each area
    - Look at whether areas with less evapotranspiration have less baseflow
  - Look at regression plot of Evapotranspiration vs. observed baseflow
